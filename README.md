# Elsevier

A one page web app for use at conferences, to demo medical study learning environment and collect emails for newsletter.

3 multiple choice questions and a sign-up form for the Elsevier newsletter.

This repo is a copy of the original repo. As this application is used at multiple conferences and events, this 2nd one was created to host a different form for a different event.
